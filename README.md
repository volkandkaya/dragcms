# dragcms

##It is a cms with ability to drag around titles, content(text), link youtube videos and show images. 

##It is linked up to a django backend which allows it to save.

Clone the repo, set up your virtual env, download the dependencies, set up PostgreSQL, migrate database and then run the server. To view an article you will need to create one and add sections to it.

I plan on: 
###Updating the layout
###Adding user accounts
###Adding admin page
###Setting up a report area with figures such as views
